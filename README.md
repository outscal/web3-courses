# Welcome to Outscal's learning community

-----------------------------------------

At Outscal, we are building a community of gaming and web3 developers across the globe. We have been curating course material for game development since 2018 and now started to create content for web3 as well. We thought that now would be a great time to share these courses on the web for free so that anyone can learn and contribute to the growing game and web3 development ecosystem.

Going forward all of our course will be added here so you can directly. If you are looking to contribute follow the instructions on our [CONTRIBUTIONS PAGE](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
