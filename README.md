# Welcome to Outscal's learning community

-----------------------------------------

Since 2018, Outscal has been curating course material for game development and web3. We thought that now would be a great time to share these courses on the web so that anyone can learn and contribute to the growing game and web3 development industry.

Going forward all of our course will be added here so you can directly. If you are looking to contribute follow the instructions on our [CONTRIBUTIONS PAGE](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
